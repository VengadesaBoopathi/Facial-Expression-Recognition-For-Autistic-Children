Project Title: Facial Expression Recognition for Autistic Children

Project Description: Developed a PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, aimed at classifying facial expressions to aid in the emotional understanding of autistic children. This model serves as a tool for enhancing communication by interpreting key emotional cues.

Key Responsibilities:

Sourced Dataset: Utilized a specialized dataset from Kaggle, containing diverse facial expressions of autistic children, to train the model.
Data Preprocessing: Implemented data loading and normalization techniques to prepare the dataset for efficient model training.
Model Architecture: Designed and defined a custom CNN architecture tailored to capture the nuances of facial expressions.
Loss Function & Optimizer: Selected and defined appropriate loss functions and optimizers to refine model learning.
Model Training: Conducted rigorous training sessions with the train data, fine-tuning the model for optimal performance.
Testing & Validation: Evaluated the model against test data, achieving an accuracy of 60%, demonstrating the modelâ€™s capability to generalize across unseen data.
Achievements:

Successfully built a model that recognizes six fundamental emotions: natural, anger, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, which are critical for understanding the emotional state of autistic children.
Contributed to the field of assistive technology by creating a tool that can potentially improve the quality of life for autistic children and their caregivers.
Technologies Used: PyTorch, Kaggle, Python
